# TinyGrad Research TODO

## Memory Management and Performance Questions

### GPU Memory Loading
- **Question**: Can TinyGrad load model weights in parallel into the GPU memory?
  - **Research Areas**: Multi-threaded weight loading, GPU memory bandwidth utilization
  - **Investigation**: Check if weight loading can be parallelized across multiple streams/threads
  - **Performance Impact**: Could significantly reduce model loading time for large models

### JIT Compilation Timing
- **Question**: Does TinyGrad run JIT compilation at the same time as loading weights into memory (or one at a time, or once completed)?
  - **Research Areas**: JIT compilation pipeline, weight loading synchronization
  - **Investigation**: Determine if compilation happens during weight loading or afterwards
  - **Performance Impact**: Overlapping these operations could reduce total initialization time

### Memory Paging for Large Models
- **Question**: For very large models, can the weights be paged into memory (and out) on demand as the inference is occurring?
  - **Research Areas**: Dynamic weight paging, memory-efficient inference, model sharding
  - **Investigation**: Check if TinyGrad supports on-demand weight loading during inference
  - **Performance Impact**: Could enable inference on models larger than available GPU memory
  - **Related**: How does this interact with model sharding across multiple GPUs?

### Cache Management System
- **Question**: How does TinyGrad manage the cache (Redis or other storage system)?
  - **Research Areas**: Cache backend implementation, storage mechanisms, cache persistence
  - **Investigation**: Examine if TinyGrad uses SQLite, Redis, filesystem, or custom storage
  - **Performance Impact**: Understanding cache architecture for optimization opportunities

### Cache Search and Inspection
- **Question**: How can we search the cache for kernels that may be compiled or not?
  - **Research Areas**: Cache query APIs, kernel fingerprinting, compilation status tracking
  - **Investigation**: Methods to programmatically inspect cache contents and compilation state
  - **Performance Impact**: Could enable intelligent pre-compilation strategies

### Cache Sharing and Fingerprinting
- **Question**: How can we save caches for a given fingerprint (OS, CPU, GPU, model) configuration so that it can be shared to other cloud cluster members to speed up cold start?
  - **Research Areas**: Cache portability, hardware fingerprinting, cluster cache synchronization
  - **Investigation**: Cache serialization/deserialization, hardware compatibility validation
  - **Performance Impact**: Could dramatically reduce cold start times in distributed environments
  - **Related**: Cache versioning, invalidation strategies, security considerations

### Distributed Model Provisioning
- **Question**: How can we provision the weights and kernels of very large models across GPUs on a single machine, but also across GPUs on remote machines (over HTTP)?
  - **Research Areas**: Distributed inference, remote GPU communication, network-aware sharding
  - **Investigation**:
    - Single-machine multi-GPU weight distribution
    - Remote GPU communication protocols (HTTP/gRPC/custom)
    - Network bandwidth optimization for weight transfer
    - Fault tolerance for remote GPU failures
  - **Performance Impact**: Enable inference on models larger than single-machine capacity
  - **Related**: Load balancing, network latency handling, synchronization protocols
